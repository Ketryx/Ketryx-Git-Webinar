# Ketryx Git Webinar

This is a sample repository highlighting the Ketryx features around [Git-based configuration items](https://docs.ketryx.com/manuals/man-09-git-based-configuration-items) for our [webinar about Git for IEC 62304](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ketryx_register-today-activity-7181351604917280768-RTpJ/).

The sample code itself is a tiny web application based on [Create Next App](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app#readme).
